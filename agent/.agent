## DETECTED ERRORS:

### CYCLE 44 - 2026-01-02 (PAGE STRUCTURE REGRESSIONS)
[2026-01-02T18:00:00] | SYSTEM | HIGH | src/App.jsx | handleShuffle accesses 'rootItems' directly instead of 'rootItems[currentPageIndex].items', breaking training mode for multi-page boards.
[2026-01-02T18:05:00] | FUNCTIONALITY | HIGH | src/App.jsx | Folder navigation broken in modals: 'EditModal' (item prop) and 'Grid' (folder prop) still traverse 'rootItems' directly, causing crashes when opening nested items on Page 2+.
[2026-01-02T18:10:00] | UI/UX | MEDIUM | src/components/Grid.jsx | Missing Pagination UI: Prop 'pages' is received but no visual indicator (dots) or switcher is rendered at the bottom of the grid.
[2026-01-02T18:15:00] | DATA | MEDIUM | src/App.jsx | 'PickerModal', 'Phase1TargetSelector', and 'Dashboard' props receive the full pages array instead of current items, breaking search and progress tracking.
[2026-01-02T18:20:00] | STABILITY | LOW | src/App.jsx | 'onAddFavorites' logic needs to be page-aware; currently attempts to splice into the pages array directly.

### CYCLE 35 - 2026-01-01 (TYPESCRIPT & RUNTIME STABILITY)
[2026-01-01T23:45:00] | SYSTEM | CRITICAL | src/plugins/superwall-web.ts | Class 'SuperwallWeb' incorrectly implements interface 'SuperwallPlugin'. Missing 'restore()' method. (RESOLVED: 2026-01-02)
[2026-01-01T23:45:05] | FUNCTIONALITY | HIGH | src/components/Controls.jsx | Runtime crash imminent: calls 'Superwall.restore()' which is undefined in the web implementation. (RESOLVED: 2026-01-02)
[2026-01-01T23:45:10] | SYSTEM | LOW | Global | 'typescript' is missing from package.json devDependencies despite .ts files being present in the source. (VERIFIED: Present in package.json)

## FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS (Agent: Kiwi Voice Agent):

### PHASE 28: MULTI-PAGE BOARDS (IN PROGRESS)
- [X] **Data Structure Migration:** Basic wrapping implemented.
- [X] **Logic Updates:** handleAddItem, handleDelete, handleSaveEdit updated for pages.
- [ ] **UI Implementation:** Pagination switcher (dots) still missing from Grid.jsx.
- [ ] **Traversal Fixes:** Nested folders and components still need page-awareness.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FIXER AGENT:
1. **Standardize Traversal:** Update all `rootItems.reduce`, `rootItems.find`, and `rootItems.map` calls in `App.jsx` to start from `rootItems[currentPageIndex].items`.
2. **Render Pagination:** Add a dot-based switcher at the bottom of `Grid.jsx` using `pages` and `onSetPage`.
3. **Fix Prop Passing:** Pass `rootItems[currentPageIndex].items` instead of `rootItems` to `Controls`, `PickerModal`, `Phase1TargetSelector`, and `Dashboard`.
4. **Onboarding Update:** Ensure `Onboarding.jsx` name/photo step is fully verified and persists correctly to the default profile.
