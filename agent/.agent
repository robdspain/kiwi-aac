## DETECTED ERRORS:

### CYCLE 30 - 2026-01-01 (CENTERING & SCALE REFINEMENT)
[2026-01-01T21:00:00] | UX_UI | HIGH | src/components/Grid.jsx | Icons are too small in Level 1/2. Needs 'max-width: none' and large viewport scaling (e.g., 60vw).
[2026-01-01T21:00:05] | UX_UI | HIGH | src/index.css | Vertical centering fails in Phase 1/2. Grid needs absolute 'center' alignment in both axes.
[2026-01-01T21:00:10] | UX_UI | MEDIUM | src/App.jsx | 'Home' and 'Level' text is too high-contrast. Needs 'opacity: 0.3' Zen styling to avoid distracting the child.
[2026-01-01T21:00:15] | UX_UI | VERIFIED | Global | Settings button subtlety verified; now transparent and non-distracting.
