## DETECTED ERRORS:

### CYCLE 36 - 2026-01-02 (AAC FEATURES & STABILITY)
[2026-01-02T10:00:00] | UI/UX | MEDIUM | src/components/PickerModal.jsx | ARASAAC search results are not cleared when a new search starts or fails, leading to residual/incorrect icons being displayed. (RESOLVED: 2026-01-02)
[2026-01-02T10:05:00] | SYSTEM | MEDIUM | src/components/PickerModal.jsx | LocalStorage overflow risk: Storing 50 base64 images (~5MB) plus board data exceeds 5MB limit on many browsers. Recommended limit: 20-30 images. (RESOLVED: 2026-01-02)
[2026-01-02T10:10:00] | FUNCTIONALITY | LOW | src/App.jsx | Auto-scanning continues in background when modals are open, potentially causing accidental triggers. (RESOLVED: 2026-01-02)
[2026-01-02T10:15:00] | UI/UX | MEDIUM | src/App.jsx | Core Words Overlay logic is overwritten by Phase 1/2/3 filters, breaking muscle memory consistency at root level. (RESOLVED: 2026-01-02)
[2026-01-02T10:20:00] | STABILITY | LOW | src/components/EditModal.jsx | Potential race condition: User can click 'Done' before async image processing (onload) completes, resulting in unsaved changes. (RESOLVED: 2026-01-02)
[2026-01-02T10:45:00] | DATA | LOW | src/App.jsx | Analytics Gap: Individual item clicks are not being tracked via 'trackItemClick' in handleItemClick, only full sentences are tracked. (RESOLVED: 2026-01-02)

### CYCLE 35 - 2026-01-01 (TYPESCRIPT & RUNTIME STABILITY)
[2026-01-01T23:45:00] | SYSTEM | CRITICAL | src/plugins/superwall-web.ts | Class 'SuperwallWeb' incorrectly implements interface 'SuperwallPlugin'. Missing 'restore()' method. (RESOLVED: 2026-01-02)
[2026-01-01T23:45:05] | FUNCTIONALITY | HIGH | src/components/Controls.jsx | Runtime crash imminent: calls 'Superwall.restore()' which is undefined in the web implementation. (RESOLVED: 2026-01-02)
[2026-01-01T23:45:10] | SYSTEM | LOW | Global | 'typescript' is missing from package.json devDependencies despite .ts files being present in the source. (VERIFIED: Present in package.json)

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FIXER AGENT:
1. **PickerModal Fix:** Call `setArasaacSymbols([])` at the beginning of `searchARASAAC` to clear stale results.
2. **Storage Optimization:** Reduce `localStorage` photo limit from 50 to 20 to prevent data loss.
3. **Scanning Safety:** Pause the auto-scanning interval in `App.jsx` when any modal (`editModalOpen`, `pickerOpen`, etc.) is active.
4. **Muscle Memory Fix:** Move the Dynamic Core Overlay logic in `App.jsx` to be the *last* filter applied to `itemsToShow` (unless in Training Mode).
5. **EditModal Race Condition:** Add a `processing` state to `EditModal.jsx` and disable the "Done" button while an image is being resized.
6. **Analytics Tracking:** Add `trackItemClick(item.id || item.word, item.word)` within `handleItemClick` in `App.jsx`.
