## DETECTED ERRORS:

### CYCLE 51 - 2026-01-02 (CLOUD SYNC AUDIT)
[2026-01-02T23:59:00] | SYSTEM | CRITICAL | src/services/CloudSyncService.js | Incomplete Sync: Service only migrates 'localStorage' data. IndexedDB (KiwiMediaDB) containing custom photos and audio is ignored, leading to data loss on 'Link Existing Device'.
[2026-01-02T23:59:15] | SYSTEM | MEDIUM | .env | Missing Configuration: VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are missing from environment, disabling Cloud Sync in production.
[2026-01-02T23:59:30] | UI/UX | LOW | src/components/BackupRestore.jsx | Misleading UX: UI claims backup includes "all boards, custom icons, voice recordings" but 'Cloud Sync' and 'Export' currently omit IndexedDB media.

### CYCLE 50 - 2026-01-02 (FINAL PRODUCTION READINESS)
[2026-01-02T23:50:00] | MONETIZATION | VERIFIED | src/utils/paywall.js | FIXED: Check functions now return the updated access status after paywall interaction.
[2026-01-02T23:55:00] | SYSTEM | VERIFIED | src/services/RevenueCatService.js | FIXED: API keys moved to environment variables (import.meta.env) for production security.
[2026-01-02T23:58:00] | SYSTEM | VERIFIED | src/App.jsx | Residual flat-array logic in 'triggerSuccess' and 'handleItemClick' resolved. Multi-page traversal fully verified.

### CYCLE 49 - 2026-01-02 (MULTI-PAGE DATA CONSISTENCY)
[2026-01-02T23:00:00] | SYSTEM | CRITICAL | src/App.jsx | Residual flat-array logic. (RESOLVED: 2026-01-02)
[2026-01-02T23:05:00] | UI/UX | MEDIUM | src/components/Dashboard.jsx | Incomplete Analytics. (RESOLVED: 2026-01-02)
[2026-01-02T23:10:00] | SYSTEM | LOW | src/components/Controls.jsx | Unused imports. (RESOLVED: 2026-01-02)
